Certainly! Below is an example of what your README.md file for the limit monitor application task might look like on GitHub:


Limit Monitor Application

This is a limit monitor application built with Django RESTframework, which allows users to monitor weather conditions and trigger actions based on predefined criteria.



The monitoring logic of the application involves comparing fetched weather data with user-defined criteria. It evaluates conditions based on comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==) specified by the user and determines if the condition is met for the given frequency (day, month, year). If the condition is satisfied, actions such as updating the database or sending notifications are triggered.

CRUD Operations

The application supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations 

Status Update

The status of records is updated based on predefined conditions. For example, the status may be updated to "Completed" if a certain date is reached or if certain criteria are met.

Scheduler Task
